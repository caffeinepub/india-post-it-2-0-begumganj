# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Remove the “Built with … using caffeine.ai” attribution (including heart icon and external link) from the app footer so it is not displayed anywhere in the UI.

**Planned changes:**
- Remove the footer attribution block that contains the “Built with” / “using” text, heart icon, and the external link to “caffeine.ai”.
- Ensure other existing footer content remains unchanged (e.g., copyright and disclaimer).
- Verify there is no remaining visible “caffeine.ai” branding text/link anywhere in the app UI.

**User-visible outcome:** The footer no longer shows any “Built with … using caffeine.ai” attribution or caffeine.ai link, while all other footer content remains visible and unchanged.
