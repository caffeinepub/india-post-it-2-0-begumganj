# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Publish the latest draft build of India Post Portal to production so end users get the updated UI/behavior.

**Planned changes:**
- Promote the currently deployed draft build to the live/production deployment.
- Ensure the profile image full-screen preview overlay retains the smooth zoom + fade animation on open/close, and can be dismissed via backdrop click, Escape key, and close button.

**User-visible outcome:** The production/live URL matches the latest draft experience, including the smooth animated profile image preview overlay with the same dismissal options.
