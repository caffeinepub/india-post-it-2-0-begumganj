    "UI/UX target: official-style website with 4K responsive layout and GPU-accelerated transitions.",
    "Design system: Dark Luxury palette (#0D0D0D base, #FF3131 neon red, #D4AF37 metallic gold) and frosted-glass surfaces.",
    "Interaction pattern: click-to-open frosted-glass modal (25px blur) with consistent 4-tab information architecture across schemes.",
    "Dashboard uses 3D floating glossy icons; scheme content includes 2026 rates/benefits and document checklists.",
    "Embedded calculators require real-time updates from slider and manual input.",
    "Profile card should use a real profile image asset (not just a placeholder); support swapping the image via a static file reference in the frontend.",
    "Ensure high-contrast typography on Dark Luxury theme (no black text on dark backgrounds); standardize to white/near-white text and adjust styling for a more official/government-site feel.",
    "SSA scheme iconography requirement updated: use a small girl visual instead of piggy bank for Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana card/icon.",
    "Live calculator deposit amount input: when input background is white/light, ensure high-contrast text (requested: red) for readability.",
    "Add a dedicated Call action (tel:7771991108) as a bottom-positioned icon/button with a subtle live/animated indicator; separate from WhatsApp CTA."

    "Some text appears black on dark background causing low contrast/readability; needs switching to white/near-white and overall styling refinement for official look.",
