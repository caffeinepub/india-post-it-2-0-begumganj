  "summary": "Diff includes substantial new backend data migration/authorization changes and broad frontend UI/style/content updates. It does include a ProfileImagePreviewOverlay component implementing smooth zoom + fade with backdrop click, Escape key, and close button behavior. However, there is no evidence of any production promotion/deployment configuration change in the provided diff summary, and many changes appear to add or alter UI beyond the stated non-goals.",

      "reason": "The diff summary shows code changes but no deployment/promotion artifacts (e.g., CI/CD config, environment/hosting config, release tags) indicating that the draft was promoted to production or that the production URL now serves the draft build.",
      "evidence": [
