  "summary": "The diff does not demonstrate a rollback of the recent blink/color changes. Instead, it introduces/retains multiple animations and styling changes (e.g., gallery glow, floating button ping/pulse, Tailwind animation tokens, and a noted live-blink heading in SchemeGrid per the file summary). There is no clear evidence that the specified blink-related utility classes (`icon-live-blink-2s`, `heading-primary-live`, `close-x-live-blink-3s`) were removed from all React components or that their corresponding CSS/animation definitions were disabled/removed.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Remove the recently introduced \"live blink\" icon animation across the site by eliminating usage of the `icon-live-blink-2s` class and removing (or disabling) the corresponding CSS animation so icons no longer blink.",
      "reason": "The diff summary does not show removal of `icon-live-blink-2s` usages or removal/disablement of its CSS/keyframes. Additionally, other icon-related animations remain (e.g., ping/pulse/glow effects), which conflicts with the acceptance criterion that no icons blink anywhere.",

      "requirement": "Restore headings to their previous styling by removing the `heading-primary-live` class wherever applied and removing (or disabling) its CSS so headings are no longer forced to dark red and do not blink.",
      "reason": "No evidence is shown that `heading-primary-live` was removed from components or that its CSS was removed/disabled. The file summary explicitly mentions a 'dark red section heading with 2-second live blink animation' in SchemeGrid, which suggests heading blink behavior still exists somewhere.",

      "requirement": "Restore modal/overlay close (X) buttons to their previous appearance by removing the `close-x-live-blink-3s` class from all close icons and removing (or disabling) its CSS so close icons are not forced red and do not blink.",
      "reason": "The diff shows X icons styled as `text-official-primary`, but does not provide evidence that `close-x-live-blink-3s` was removed everywhere or that its CSS was removed/disabled. Without explicit removal evidence, the requirement is not verifiably implemented.",

      "reason": "The diff includes/retains various new or non-rollback animations/utilities (gallery glow animation, modal enter animations, ping effects, Tailwind pulse ring animation token per summary) rather than demonstrating removal of blink/color utilities. The summary also indicates ongoing animation support rather than a cleanup of blink-related utilities.",
